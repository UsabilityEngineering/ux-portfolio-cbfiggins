# Confusion on Navair's Website
## By Curtis Figgins 3/4/21

I'm confident with my ability to use and learn new technology. As a computer science student who has 
being using computers for over a decade, I am experienced navigating websites and have got used to 
trends with how developers layout the UI and navigation for their websites. Navair changed how I expected some 
of these things to function based on my experiences with other websites.

What brought me to Navair's website in the first place was to learn about their company because they 
would be attending Chico State's Technical Career Fair. My goal was to learn more about them and the careers
that they offer. 

My first inclination when getting to the website was to look for some sort of menu at the top of the page. 
Typically I see a menu in the top left of webpages but Navair chose to put it in the right with a hamburger 
button.

When clicking on the menu button I expected it to drop down with my choices below it. However, the choices 
were displayed back on the opposite side of the screen where I originally would have expected the menu to be 
in the first place. This made me more puzzled to why they chose to put the menu in the right corner. 
Next I chose to go to the career page for civilians. 

Like the homepage they used a hamburger menu in the corner but this time with different options for career related stuff. 
After doing some research I wanted to go back to the homepage. From experience, normally the company or website's 
icon/symbol takes you back to the homepage so I clicked on that.

This only took me back to the career homepage which was not what I wanted. I tried the menu to see if I could get back to 
the navair homepage from there but no luck as well. The only way I ended up finding out how to get back without pressing the 
back button however many times, was to click on a little link in the bottom left corner that said "NAVAIR home". It didn't help that
I had to scroll down the page to find it.
