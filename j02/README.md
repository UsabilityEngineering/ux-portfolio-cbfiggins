# Learning to play Age of Empires
## By Curtis Figgins 4/25/21

Age of Empires 2 is a strategy game where you compete with other players to build your civilizations while attacking your opponents to defeat them. Each player starts out with a few villagers and a town center and have to gather resources to make new villagers and buildings. 

When you click on a villager, you can see the buildings they can build in the bottom left corner.

As you can see in the picture, there are icons the represent the different buildings you can create. When you highlight over them it also gives a description of what they do. This also applies to making military units; they get a description of what they do and of their strengths and weaknessses. This is an example of how the developers do a good job at increasing the game's **learnability**. The game uses icons to represent most things which is a good way to get an idea of what they might do. 

As you create more villagers you need to put them on different resources to make sure you have enough to build buildings and purchase upgrades. You need to make sure you have a balanced economy so you aren't running out of any specific resource.

The more villagers you create, the more you can grow your economy. This also means you have more to manage. While the developers did a good job at making the different buttons and actions **learnable**, learning to properly manage your villagers will take lots of practice. In order to get good at the game, you need to make sure that you never have any villagers standing idle. They should always be building or gathering resources. This gets very difficult when you have dozens of villagers and are trying to manage an army at the same time.

You want to build an army to attack your opponents, but also so you can defend your base. Fighting other players can distract you from your villagers and base which can lead you to fall behind economically. It is hard to manage multiple things at once, especially when you have over 100 units to manage. This is what actually makes the game not very **learnable** overall. It isn't too difficult to learn different parts of the game, but when you put it all together and do it all at once it can be very difficult and overwhelming. You need to make sure you are always researching upgrades, collecting resources, building houses, building defenses, etc. Learning to manage all these things effectively and to be able to come up with good strategies to defeat you opponents can take hundreds of hours of work, making this game not easy to learn.

While this game takes a lot of effort to learn, it is also very **memorable**. Lots of the things you do in the game become a habit. The game has hotkeys on the keyboard that can do actions rather than clicking on the icons with your mouse. This speeds things up and is easy to remember once you learn them. I'm at the point where if I want to build certain buildings I just press the key to create it from memory. Once you learn things about the game it is easy to remember them, but there is just always more to learn and improve on. Every game I play I am learning what I need to improve on and I remember to work on that in my next match.
