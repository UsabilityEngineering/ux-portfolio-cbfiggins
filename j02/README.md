# Learning to play Age of Empires
## By Curtis Figgins 4/25/21

Age of Empires 2 is a strategy game where you compete with other players to build your civilizations while attacking your opponents to defeat them. Each player starts out with a few villagers and a town center and have to gather resources to make new villagers and buildings. When you click on a villager, you can see the buildings they can build in the bottom left corner.
