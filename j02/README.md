# Learning to play Age of Empires
## By Curtis Figgins 4/25/21

Age of Empires 2 is a strategy game where you compete with other players to build your civilizations while attacking your opponents to defeat them. Each player starts out with a few villagers and a town center and have to gather resources to make new villagers and buildings. 

When you click on a villager, you can see the buildings they can build in the bottom left corner.

As you can see in the picture, there are icons the represent the different buildings you can create. When you highlight over them it also gives a description of what they do. This also applies to making military units; they get a description of what they do and of their strengths and weaknessses. This is an example of how the developers do a good job at increasing the game's learnability.
